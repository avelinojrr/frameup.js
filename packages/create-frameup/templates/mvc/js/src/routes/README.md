# Routes Folder - README Guide

## Purpose
The **routes** folder is responsible for defining the endpoints of your application. Routes determine how the application responds to client requests for a specific URL, including what data should be returned, or what actions should be taken. This folder serves as a bridge between the client requests and the corresponding controller logic that processes them.

## Structure
The routes folder typically contains files that correspond to the different entities in your application, with each file managing the endpoints for that entity. This organization helps to keep route definitions clean, modular, and easy to manage.

### Example Structure:
```
routes/
  userRoutes.js
  productRoutes.js
  orderRoutes.js
```

## Responsibilities
- **Define Endpoints**: Declare all the possible HTTP endpoints (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for an entity.
- **Delegate to Controllers**: Routes should simply define paths and delegate the actual logic to controllers.
- **Middleware Integration**: Attach relevant middleware functions, such as authentication, validation, or logging, to the appropriate routes.

## Example Routes (`userRoutes.js`)
```js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const userController = require('../controllers/userController');
const authMiddleware = require('../middlewares/authMiddleware');

// Public route for creating a new user
router.post('/register', userController.createUser);

// Protected route for getting user details
router.get('/:id', authMiddleware, userController.getUserById);

// Update user details
router.put('/:id', authMiddleware, userController.updateUser);

// Delete user
router.delete('/:id', authMiddleware, userController.deleteUser);

module.exports = router;
```

## Best Practices
1. **Keep Routes Simple**: Routes should only handle the routing logic. Business logic should be kept in controllers.
2. **Use Consistent Naming**: Use RESTful conventions for defining routes (e.g., `/users`, `/products`). This ensures consistency and makes it easier to understand what each route does.
3. **Apply Middleware Where Necessary**: Use middleware for tasks like authentication, validation, and logging to ensure consistent and reusable logic across routes.
4. **Organize by Entity**: Organize route files by entity (e.g., user, product) to keep them modular and maintainable.
5. **Versioning**: Consider using API versioning in your routes (e.g., `/api/v1/users`) to manage backward compatibility as your application evolves.

## Summary
- The routes folder contains the endpoint definitions for your application.
- Routes handle client requests by specifying paths and delegating the actual work to controllers.
- Middleware can be attached to routes to handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, validation, and logging.

By following these best practices, you ensure that your routing layer remains organized, simple, and easy to maintain. This makes it easier to expand your application, as new features and entities can be added without introducing complexity to the routing structure.
