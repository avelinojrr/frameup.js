# ðŸ“‚ Services Folder - README Guide

## Purpose
The **services** folder is responsible for implementing business logic and abstracting the complexities of data manipulation, ensuring that controllers remain thin and focused on handling HTTP requests. Additionally, this folder incorporates design patterns like **Dependency Injection (DI)** and **Service Layer** to improve modularity, maintainability, and testability.

## Responsibilities
- **Business Logic**: Encapsulate all application-specific business logic.
- **Abstraction**: Interact with the data layer (e.g., repositories) to retrieve or manipulate data, while hiding these details from controllers.
- **Dependency Injection**: Manage dependencies by injecting required services or components, making the code more modular and testable.
- **Service Layer**: Centralize reusable logic to promote separation of concerns and ensure consistency across the application.

## Structure
Organize service files by feature or domain. For instance, if the application has users, products, and orders, each would have its own service file.

### Example Structure:
```
src/
  services/
    userService.js
    productService.js
    orderService.js
```

## Example Implementation

### User Service (`userService.js`)
```js
import UserRepository from '../repositories/userRepository.js';

class UserService {
  constructor(userRepository) {
    this.userRepository = userRepository; // Dependency Injection
  }

  async getAllUsers() {
    return await this.userRepository.findAll();
  }

  async getUserById(id) {
    const user = await this.userRepository.findById(id);
    if (!user) {
      throw new Error('User not found');
    }
    return user;
  }

  async createUser(data) {
    return await this.userRepository.create(data);
  }

  async updateUser(id, data) {
    const user = await this.userRepository.update(id, data);
    if (!user) {
      throw new Error('User not found or unable to update');
    }
    return user;
  }

  async deleteUser(id) {
    const result = await this.userRepository.delete(id);
    if (!result) {
      throw new Error('User not found or unable to delete');
    }
    return result;
  }
}

// Example usage of Dependency Injection
const userService = new UserService(new UserRepository());
export default userService;
```

### Service Layer Integration with a Controller (`userController.js`)
```js
import userService from '../services/userService.js';

class UserController {
  async getAllUsers(req, res) {
    try {
      const users = await userService.getAllUsers();
      res.status(200).json(users);
    } catch (error) {
      res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
    }
  }

  async createUser(req, res) {
    try {
      const user = await userService.createUser(req.body);
      res.status(201).json(user);
    } catch (error) {
      res.status(400).json({ error: error.message });
    }
  }

  // Additional controller methods for user operations...
}

export default new UserController();
```

## Best Practices
1. **Thin Controllers**: Keep controllers focused on handling HTTP requests and delegate business logic to services.
2. **Use Dependency Injection**: Pass dependencies like repositories to services via constructors to improve modularity and enable easier testing.
3. **Reuse Logic**: Centralize shared business logic in services to promote consistency and avoid duplication.
4. **Error Handling**: Ensure services throw meaningful errors for controllers to handle appropriately.
5. **Testing**: Write unit tests for services by mocking their dependencies to verify business logic independently.

## Summary
- The services folder encapsulates the business logic of the application, keeping controllers thin and focused.
- Incorporating patterns like Dependency Injection and Service Layer in this folder promotes modularity, testability, and separation of concerns.
- Organize services by feature or domain to maintain a clean and scalable architecture.

This structure and approach ensure that the application remains maintainable and adheres to best practices in software design.
