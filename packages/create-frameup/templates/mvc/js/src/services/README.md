# Services Folder - README Guide

## Purpose
The **services** folder is responsible for handling the business logic of your application. The service layer abstracts the core logic from the controllers, allowing you to maintain clean, readable, and reusable code. Services interact with models to retrieve or manipulate data and perform the core operations necessary for the application's functionality.

## Structure
The services folder typically contains files that represent the different entities or features of your application. Each service file should focus on a specific entity or domain logic.

### Example Structure:
```
services/
  userService.js
  productService.js
  orderService.js
```

## Responsibilities
- **Business Logic**: Centralize complex business rules and operations to keep controllers thin and maintainable.
- **Data Access**: Use models to interact with the database, handling any data-related operations such as queries, transformations, and aggregations.
- **Reusable Logic**: Create functions that can be reused across different parts of the application, making the codebase more modular and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

## Example Service (`userService.js`)
```js
const User = require('../models/userModel');

class UserService {
  // Fetch all users from the database
  async getAllUsers() {
    try {
      const users = await User.find();
      return users;
    } catch (error) {
      throw new Error('Error fetching users: ' + error.message);
    }
  }

  // Create a new user
  async createUser(userData) {
    try {
      const user = new User(userData);
      await user.save();
      return user;
    } catch (error) {
      throw new Error('Error creating user: ' + error.message);
    }
  }

  // Find a user by ID
  async getUserById(userId) {
    try {
      const user = await User.findById(userId);
      if (!user) {
        throw new Error('User not found');
      }
      return user;
    } catch (error) {
      throw new Error('Error fetching user by ID: ' + error.message);
    }
  }

  // Update user details
  async updateUser(userId, updateData) {
    try {
      const updatedUser = await User.findByIdAndUpdate(userId, updateData, { new: true });
      if (!updatedUser) {
        throw new Error('User not found for update');
      }
      return updatedUser;
    } catch (error) {
      throw new Error('Error updating user: ' + error.message);
    }
  }

  // Delete a user
  async deleteUser(userId) {
    try {
      const deletedUser = await User.findByIdAndDelete(userId);
      if (!deletedUser) {
        throw new Error('User not found for deletion');
      }
      return deletedUser;
    } catch (error) {
      throw new Error('Error deleting user: ' + error.message);
    }
  }
}

module.exports = new UserService();
```

## Best Practices
1. **Thin Controllers**: Keep your controllers thin by delegating all business logic to services. Controllers should only handle HTTP-specific concerns (e.g., request, response).
2. **Modular and Reusable**: Services should be reusable across different parts of the application. Write functions that can be called from multiple controllers or other services.
3. **Error Handling**: Always handle errors gracefully and propagate meaningful messages to make debugging easier.
4. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each service should focus on a specific domain (e.g., user, product) and handle operations related to that domain.
5. **Testability**: Keeping business logic in services makes it easier to write unit tests, as the logic is decoupled from HTTP concerns.

## Summary
- The services folder centralizes the business logic of your application.
- Services interact with models to handle data operations and apply business rules, keeping the controllers clean.
- Following best practices for services ensures your code is reusable, maintainable, and easy to test.

By adhering to these guidelines, you create a maintainable and scalable service layer that contributes to the overall robustness of your application's architecture.
