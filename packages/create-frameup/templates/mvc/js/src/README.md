# 🚀 Project README - Generated Project Overview

## 🎉 Introduction
Welcome to the generated project! This project is a backend application built using **Node.js** and **Express.js**. It follows the **MVC architecture** (Model-View-Controller) to maintain a clean separation of concerns, making it easier to understand and extend.

This README provides a brief overview of the project structure, including key files and folders, as well as basic instructions to run and use the project.

## 📁 Project Structure
The generated project structure is organized to separate responsibilities and maintain modularity. Here is an overview of the main folders and files:

> [!NOTE]
> Design patterns are not included in the project structure. You can add them based on your requirements.

## 📄 Key Files Explained
### `app.js`
The `app.js` file is responsible for setting up the Express application. It connects the middleware, routes, and any necessary configurations to form the main application logic.

> [!TIP]
> You can add more middleware, paths or settings to the app.js file as needed. But keep it as clean as possible so that it is easy to understand and maintain. A good practice is to add descriptive comments about what the function does.

**Example (`app.js`):**
```js
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

import userRoutes from './src/routes/userRoutes.js';

// Middleware setup
app.use(express.json());

// Routes setup
app.use('/api/users', userRoutes);

// Error handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  res.status(err.status || 500).json({ error: err.message });
});

export default app;
```

### `index.js`
The `index.js` file is the main entry point of the application. It initializes the server and starts listening for incoming requests.

> [!TIP]
> Consider adding database connection logic or other setup code to the `index.js` file. This ensures that the server is ready to handle requests once it starts.

**Example (`index.js`):**
```js
import app from './app.js';
import {connectToDatabase} from './src/database/db.js';

async function startServer() {
  await connectToDatabase(); // Connect to the database
  
  const PORT = process.env.PORT || 4000; // The PORT recommend for development is 4000

  app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
  });

}

startServer();

```

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **📦 Dependencies are automatically installed when the project is generated. You can proceed to initialize the server using any of the following package managers:**

2. **🔧 Set up environment variables**
   
   >[!IMPORTANT]
   > Within the `.env` file, you can define environment variables such as `PORT`, `DB_URI` and `JWT_SECRET`, among others. These variables are used to configure the server, connect to the database, and manage JWT tokens, respectively, thus maintaining security of sensitive data such as the database connection or the port to which your server is exposed.
   ```
   PORT=4000
   DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

   >[!CAUTION]
    > Remember not include the `.env` file in your version control system (e.g., Git) to avoid exposing sensitive information. Instead, add it to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being tracked.

3. **▶️ Run the server**
   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm start

   # Using yarn
   yarn start

   # Using pnpm
   pnpm start
   ```


4. **🚀 Access the server**
   'http://localhost:3000'


## 🗂️ Project Structure Explained
- **🛠️ Config**: Contains configuration files and settings for the project.
- **📋 Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and delegate tasks to services, sending responses back to the client.
- **🧠 Services**: Implement business logic and use DAOs to interact with the database.
- **💾 DAO (Data Access Object)**: Provide an abstraction over the database, handling direct data access.
- **📦 DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Define the shape of data transferred between layers to ensure consistency.
- **🗄️ Database**: Manages database connections and any related configurations.
- **📐 Models**: Define the database schema and structure using tools like Mongoose or Sequelize.
- **🌐 Routes**: Define application endpoints and link them to the appropriate controllers.
- **🔒 Middlewares**: Manage cross-cutting concerns, such as authentication or logging.
- **🔧 Utils**: Contain reusable utility functions that can be used throughout the application.
- **🌍 Public**: Store static files, like CSS and images.
- **🧪 Tests**: Contain unit and integration tests to verify functionality.

## 📝 Available Scripts
- **🚀 Start Server**: Run the application in development mode.
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

  - If you are using `yarn` or `pnpm`, you can run the following command:
  ```bash
  yarn dev
  pnpm dev
  ```

- **🧪 Run Tests**: Execute unit and integration tests.
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

## 📚 Additional Notes
- **Eslint Configuration**: If you want to maintain consistent coding standards across your project, you can use **ESLint** to lint your code. ESLint helps identify problematic patterns and maintain a clean codebase. To get started with ESLint, follow this guide: [How to Set Up ESLint in Your Project](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/getting-started).

## 📌 Summary
This project provides a backend structure following **MVC principles** to maintain a clean separation of concerns. The generated files are meant to serve as a starting point for building scalable and maintainable Node.js applications.

Feel free to explore each folder and file to understand how everything is connected. By following best practices and maintaining a well-structured project, you'll ensure that your application is modular, easy to understand, and ready for future growth.
