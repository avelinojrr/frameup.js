# ⚙️ Configuration Folder - README Guide

## Purpose

The **configuration** folder is dedicated to housing all the configuration settings for your application. These settings may include database connections, server configurations, API keys, and any other environment-specific or system-specific settings that your application needs to run smoothly.

## Structure

The configuration folder usually contains files for different aspects of the system's configuration, such as environment variables, database configuration, third-party integrations, etc. This organization helps in managing and accessing these settings in a modular way.

### Example Structure:

```
configuration/
  dbConfig.js
  serverConfig.js
  apiKeys.js
  loggerConfig.js
```

## Responsibilities

-   **Environment Management**: Store settings that vary based on the environment, such as development, staging, or production.
-   **Database Configuration**: Set up and export database connection settings, which can then be used across your services or models.
-   **Third-Party Integrations**: Manage API keys, tokens, or other third-party service settings from a centralized place.
-   **Logging and Monitoring**: Define settings for logging, such as log levels, formatters, and destinations.

## Example Configuration Files

`serverConfig.js`

```javascript
import { config } from 'dotenv';

config();

export const serverConfig = {
  port: process.env.PORT || 4000,
  host: process.env.HOST || 'localhost',
};
```

`apiKeys.js`

```javascript
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

export const apiKeys = {
	googleMaps: process.env.GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY,
	stripe: process.env.STRIPE_API_KEY,
	// Add more API keys here
};
```

## Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information like API keys and database credentials in environment variables, and use a `.env` file to manage them locally.
2. **Do Not Hardcode**: Avoid hardcoding sensitive data directly in configuration files. Instead, rely on environment variables and configuration management tools.
3. **Use a Configuration Library**: Consider using a library like `dotenv`, `config`, or `convict` to manage different environments and keep configuration consistent.
4. **Keep It Modular**: Split different aspects of the configuration (e.g., database, server, APIs) into separate files to maintain modularity and ease of management.

## Summary

-   The configuration folder centralizes all environment-specific settings for easy management.
-   It includes settings for the database, server, API keys, logging, and other third-party integrations.
-   Use environment variables and configuration management tools to keep the configuration secure and modular.

By following these guidelines, you ensure that your application's configuration remains well-organized, secure, and easy to manage across different environments.
